# DroneWarfareApp
Here is what has been completed so far.
    The program uses phaser as it engine, but you do not need to download any packages or outside resources to get the game running
Visual textures have been added to the game in the assets class

So far, Three classes have been made, the Turret, Player and game classes

Turret: Manages Defensive turrets, including targeting and firing at the player as well as the health and the damage they deal

Player: Incorporates the spawning of the player drone and controlling that one drone, with controls and firing implemented.

game: Runs the game and background, implementing the scrolling screen mechanic and the spawn area of the map.

What needs to continue to be worked on:
Please implement adding drone2 in the assets folder so that the player can place multiple drones or play as two of the different drones

Adding a game over screen drone has been destroyed or a victory screen when all turrets on the map are destroyed

Adding AI to other vehicles you can place. Currently, only one drone can be placed, and I want multiple drones to be allowed to be placed and AI behavior specified in the techSpec to be operational for those other drones.
